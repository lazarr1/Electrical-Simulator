# Guide
- Click on a component in the toolbox to create a component
- Drag the component to the desired spot
- Click on the nodes (top and bottom circles) on the component to start drawing a wire
- Connected ALL components with a wire. Do not connect a node directly do another node
- Hover over a wire to see the node voltage
- Double click a component to edit its stored parameters
- Hover over a component and press R to rotate it
- Ensure the circuit is grounded
- Hover over a component and press delete to delete it
- If the node voltage is not immediately updated or is incorrect, try pressing the run button on the bottom left. If it is still incorrect email me with a screenshot of the circuit at lazarluke02@gmail.com
